    <p>Adds a slider widget to the user interface.</p>
	<p>The user can change its value between the limits (<b>min</b> and <b>max</b>). Each value change
    will generate a message with the value set as <b>payload</b>.</p>
    <p>A vertical slider can be created by setting the size so that the height is greater than the width.</p>
    <p>The slider can be reversed by setting the min value larger than the max value. e.g. min 100, max 0.</p>
    <p>If a <b>Topic</b> is specified, it will be added as <code>msg.topic</code>.</p>
    <p>An input <code>msg.payload</code> will be converted to a number, and used to preset a value.
    The <b>min</b> value will be used if conversion fails,
    and it will update the user interface. If the value changes, it will also be passed to the output.</p>
    <p>The label can also be set by a message property by setting
    the field to the name of the property, for example <code>{{msg.topic}}</code>.</p>
    <p>Setting <code>msg.enabled</code> to <code>false</code> will disable the slider output.</p>
    <p>The state of this input widget may be made to persist node (re)starts
    by checking the "Save and restore state from persistent context" option.
    The desired context store to use may be selected once the option is
    checked. It is imperative to select a context store that <i>is</i>
    persistent (the memory context store is <i>not</i>, for example) since
    there is no programmatic way to verify the persistence feature of a given
    context store. If the "If <code>msg</code> arrives on input, pass through
    to output" option is also checked, a message is generated immediately
    after a node (re)tart.</p>
