    <p>Adds a form to user interface.</p>
    <p>Helps to collect multiple value from the user on submit button click as an object in <code>msg.payload</code> </p>
    <p>Multiple input elements can be added using add elements button</p>
    <p>Each element contains following components:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> <b>Label</b> : Value that will be the label of the element in the user interface</li>
        <li> <b>Name</b> : Represents the key (variable name) in the <code>msg.payload</code> in which the value of the corresponding element present</li>
        <li> <b>Type</b> : Drop down option to select the type of input element</li>
        <li> <b>Required</b> : On switching on the user has to supply the value before submitting</li>
        <li> <b>Rows</b> : number of UI rows for multiline text input</li>
        <li> <b>Delete</b> : To remove the current element from the form</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Optionally the <b>Topic</b> field can be used to set the <code>msg.topic</code> property.</p>
    <p>The Cancel button can be hidden by setting it's value to be blank "".</p>
    <p>The state of this input widget may be made to persist node (re)starts
    by checking the "Save and restore state from persistent context" option.
    The desired context store to use may be selected once the option is
    checked. It is imperative to select a context store that <i>is</i>
    persistent (the memory context store is <i>not</i>, for example) since
    there is no programmatic way to verify the persistence feature of a given
    context store. If the "If <code>msg</code> arrives on input, pass through
    to output" option is also checked, a message is generated immediately
    after a node (re)tart.</p>
