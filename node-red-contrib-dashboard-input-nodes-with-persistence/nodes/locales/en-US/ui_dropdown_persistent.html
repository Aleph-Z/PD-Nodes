<script type="text/html" data-help-name="ui_dropdown_persistent">
    <p>Adds a dropdown select box to the user interface.</p>
    <p>Multiple value / label pairs can be added as required. If the label is not specified the
    value will be used for both.</p>
    <p>The configured value of the selected item will be returned as <code>msg.payload</code>.</p>
    <p>Setting <code>msg.payload</code> to one of the item values will preset the choice in the dropdown.
    If using the multi-select option then the payload should be an array of values.</p>
    <p>Optionally the <b>Topic</b> field can be used to set the <code>msg.topic</code> property.</p>
    <p>The Options may be configured by inputting <code>msg.options</code> containing an array.
    If just text then the value will be the same as the label, otherwise you can specify both by
    using an object of <code>"label":"value"</code> pairs :</p>
    <code>[ "Choice 1", "Choice 2", {"Choice 3":"3"} ]</code>
    <p></p>
    <p>If the "Allow multiple selections" output option is enabled - the
    result will be returned as an array instead of a string.</p>
    <p>The state of this input widget may be made to persist node (re)starts
    by checking the "Save and restore state from persistent context" option.
    The desired context store to use may be selected once the option is
    checked. It is imperative to select a context store that <i>is</i>
    persistent (the memory context store is <i>not</i>, for example) since
    there is no programmatic way to verify the persistence feature of a given
    context store. If the "If <code>msg</code> arrives on input, pass through
    to output" option is also checked, a message is generated immediately
    after a node (re)tart.</p>
