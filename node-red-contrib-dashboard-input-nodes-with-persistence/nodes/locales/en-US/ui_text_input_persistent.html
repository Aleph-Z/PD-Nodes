<script type="text/html" data-help-name="ui_text_input_persistent">
  <p>Adds a text input field to the user interface. Mode can be regular text, email or color picker.</p>
  <p>Any input is sent as <code>msg.payload</code>. If set to ‘pass through mode’ an arriving <code>msg.payload</code>
      will be used if it is different from the existing text in the input field. This allows you to preset
      the text of the input field.</p>
  <p>The <b>Delay</b> <i>(default : 300ms)</i> sets the amount of time in milliseconds before the output is sent.
  Setting to <code>0</code> waits for "Enter" or "Tab" key to send. Enter will send payload but remain in focus.
  Tab will send payload and move to next field. Clicking elsewhere will also send the payload.</p>
  <p>The email mode will color in red if it is not a valid address and will return undefined.</p>
  <p>The time input type returns a number of milliseconds from midnight.</p>
  <p>Not all browsers support the <i>week</i> and <i>month</i> input types, and may return <i>undefined</i>.
  Please test your target browser(s) before use.</p>
  <p>If a <b>Topic</b> is specified, it will be added as <code>msg.topic</code>.</p>
  <p>Setting <code>msg.enabled</code> to <code>false</code> will disable the input.</p>
  <p>The state of this input widget may be made to persist node (re)starts by
  checking the "Save and restore state from persistent context" option. The
  desired context store to use may be selected once the option is checked. It
  is imperative to select a context store that <i>is</i> persistent (the
  memory context store is <i>not</i>, for example) since there is no
  programmatic way to verify the persistence feature of a given context
  store. If the "If <code>msg</code> arrives on input, pass through to
  output" option is also checked, a message is generated immediately after a
  node (re)tart.</p>
