<script type="text/html" data-help-name="ui_colour_picker_persistent">
    <p>Adds a colour picker to the dashboard.</p>
    <p>If the group width is 4 or greater then the picker can be set to be visible at all times.</p>
    <p><b>Format</b> can be rgb, hex, hex8, hsv, or hsl. Transparency is supported for all except hex.</p>
    <p>If a <b>Topic</b> is specified, it will be added as <code>msg.topic</code>.</p>
    <p>Setting <code>msg.enabled</code> to <code>false</code> will disable the input.</p>
    <p>If set to ‘pass through mode’ a message arriving on the input will be evaluated for any colour format available
        as Format. If the conversion fails #000000 will be used.</p>
    <p>The state of this input widget may be made to persist node (re)starts
    by checking the "Save and restore state from persistent context" option.
    The desired context store to use may be selected once the option is
    checked. It is imperative to select a context store that <i>is</i>
    persistent (the memory context store is <i>not</i>, for example) since
    there is no programmatic way to verify the persistence feature of a given
    context store. If the "If <code>msg</code> arrives on input, pass through
    to output" option is also checked, a message is generated immediately
    after a node (re)tart.</p>
