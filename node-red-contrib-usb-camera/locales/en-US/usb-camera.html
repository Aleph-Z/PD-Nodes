  <p> This module is a front-end to the <a
  href="https://github.com/fsphil/fswebcam">fswebcam</a> utility to enable
  image capturing from within Node-RED. This node is disabled if fswebcam is
  not detected. </p>
  <h3>Inputs</h3>
  <h4>Mode</h4>
  There are four capture modes:
  <ul>
      <li>Template: the node output is a string with a fully specified HTML
      <code>img</code> tag. The image is included as a Base64-encoded
      string.</li>
      <li>Encode: the node output is a Base64-encoded string with the image
      information.</li>
      <li>Buffer: the node output is an array of numbers with the image
      information.</li>
      <li>File: the node output is a string with the full path of the image
      file.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Format</h4>
  Supported image formats are JPEG and PNG.
  <h4>File name</h4>
  When the mode is <code>File</code> this input selects the location of the
  output image file, which is also communicated in the node output. The
  default is <code>${NODERED_HOME}/image.[png|jpg]</code>. The specified
  directory is created if it does not exist.
  <h4>Size</h4>
  Width x height, both have to be greater than zero. The default is
  <code>320</code>x<code>240</code>.
  <h4>Quality</h4>
  Number between <code>1</code> and <code>100</code> that determines the
  amount of compression in the captured image. <code>100</code>, the default,
  indicates no compression.
  <h4>Delay</h4>
  Approximate delay in milliseconds between the input message and the moment
  the image is captured. The default is no delay.
  <h4>Name</h4>
  Node name.
  <h3>Output</h3>
  The node output depends on the input <code>Mode</code>:
  <ul>
      <li>Template: string with a fully specified HTML <code>img</code> tag.
      The image is included as a Base64-encoded string.</li>
      <li>Encode: Base64-encoded string with the image information.</li>
      <li>Buffer: array of numbers with the image information.</li>
      <li>File: string with the full path of the image file.</li>
  </ul>
